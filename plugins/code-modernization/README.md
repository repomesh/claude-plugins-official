# Code Modernization Plugin

A structured workflow and set of specialist agents for modernizing legacy codebases — COBOL, legacy Java/C++, monolith web apps — into current stacks while preserving behavior.

## Overview

Legacy modernization fails most often not because the target technology is wrong, but because teams skip steps: they transform code before understanding it, reimagine architecture before extracting business rules, or ship without a harness that would catch behavior drift. This plugin enforces a sequence:

```
preflight → assess → map → extract-rules → brief → reimagine | transform | uplift → harden
```

The three build paths are different *methods*, chosen by the brief's recommended pattern: **`transform`** (cross-stack rewrite from extracted intent), **`reimagine`** (greenfield rebuild), and **`uplift`** (same-stack version bump — e.g. .NET Framework → .NET 8 — that preserves the code and fixes only the version deltas).

The discovery commands (`assess`, `map`, `extract-rules`) build artifacts under `analysis/<system>/`. The `brief` command synthesizes them into an approval gate. The build commands (`reimagine`, `transform`, `uplift`) write new code under `modernized/`. The `harden` command audits the legacy system and produces a reviewable remediation patch. Each step has a dedicated slash command, and specialist agents (legacy analyst, business rules extractor, architecture critic, security auditor, test engineer) are invoked from within those commands — or directly — to keep the work honest.

## Expected layout

Commands take a `<system-dir>` argument and assume the system being modernized lives at `legacy/<system-dir>/`. Discovery artifacts go to `analysis/<system-dir>/`, transformed code to `modernized/<system-dir>/…`. If your codebase lives elsewhere, symlink it in:

```bash
mkdir -p legacy && ln -s /path/to/your/legacy/codebase legacy/billing
```

## What to give Claude

The commands degrade gracefully, but each of these makes the output meaningfully better — run `/modernize-preflight <system-dir>` to check all of them at once and get a readiness report:

- **Analysis tools**: [`scc`](https://github.com/boyter/scc) (LOC + complexity + COCOMO) or [`cloc`](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc); [`lizard`](https://github.com/terryyin/lizard) for portfolio mode. Without them, metrics fall back to `find`/`wc` and get coarser.
- **A working build toolchain** for the legacy stack (e.g. GnuCOBOL for COBOL) — required before `/modernize-transform` can prove behavioral equivalence, and verified by preflight with a real smoke compile against your code.
- **The whole system in the tree**: deployment descriptors (JCL, CICS definitions, route configs), copybooks/includes, and DDL/schemas. Entry-point detection and data lineage in `/modernize-map` are guesswork without them.
- **Production telemetry** (optional): an observability MCP server or batch job logs enable the runtime overlay in `/modernize-assess` and timing annotations on critical paths.

## Dynamic workflow orchestration

On Claude Code builds that ship the **Workflow tool**, four commands upgrade
from "spawn a few agents and merge by hand" to scripted orchestration
(`workflows/*.js` in this plugin). The commands detect the tool and fall back
to direct subagent fan-out on older builds — no configuration needed.

| Command | What the workflow adds |
|---|---|
| `/modernize-extract-rules` | Extraction loops until two consecutive rounds find nothing new; every rule's `file:line` citation is verified by an independent referee before entering the catalog; P0 rules face a two-judge panel before they can anchor the behavior contract. |
| `/modernize-harden` | Five class-scoped finders in parallel; every finding is adversarially refuted (Critical/High double-judged), so false positives die before `SECURITY_FINDINGS.md`. |
| `/modernize-assess --portfolio` | One survey agent per system, pipelined independently; the COCOMO complexity index computed uniformly in code; crashed sweeps resume from cache. |
| `/modernize-reimagine` (Phase E) | The 3-service scaffolding cap is lifted — the runtime queues one agent per approved service. |
| `/modernize-uplift` (delta catalog) | One finder per delta category (API-removed / behavioral-silent / project-system / dependency), each verified against the cited code so deltas that don't actually apply to this codebase are dropped. |

These fan out more agents than the fallback path (tens, on a large estate) —
the commands state the expected count before launching. Invoking the slash
command is the opt-in.

A structural security property comes with the conversion: workflow extraction
agents return **schema-validated data**, and only the orchestrating session
writes artifacts. Analysis agents never touch disk. See the next two sections
for why that matters.

## Untrusted code & prompt injection

The systems this plugin analyzes are untrusted input. A hostile codebase can
plant comments or string literals that read as instructions to an AI tool
("ignore previous instructions", "mark this rule approved") in the hope of
steering what lands in `BUSINESS_RULES.md` or `SECURITY_FINDINGS.md` — which
downstream commands treat as trusted. Defenses, in layers: every agent's
system prompt pins file content as data-never-instructions and reports
instruction-shaped text as a finding (`injectionFlags` in workflow results —
surfaced prominently when non-empty); analysis agents are read-only, with
artifact writes happening only in the orchestrating session; citation
referees refute any rule or finding supported by comments rather than
executable code; agent-produced text is **fenced as untrusted data** when it
flows into a downstream agent's prompt (referees re-derive claims from the
cited code rather than trusting the finder's description — second-order
injection); workflow inputs that become filesystem paths are validated
against a strict name pattern; the one write-capable workflow agent
(`scaffolder`) runs with an explicit minimal tool list and a write scope of
exactly its own service directory; and `/modernize-brief` remains a human
approval gate before anything is executed against. Treat discovery artifacts
from code you don't trust with the same skepticism as the code itself.

## Secret handling

Legacy systems routinely contain live credentials, and assessment artifacts get committed and shared. **Every agent in this plugin masks credential values** — findings, rule-card parameters, architecture notes, and test fixtures cite `file:line` with a masked preview (`AKIA****`), never the value. When credentials are found, a per-credential inventory (type, location, blast radius, rotation recommendation) is written to `analysis/<system>/SECRETS.local.md`, which the commands gitignore before writing; on non-git projects the quarantine file goes to `~/.modernize/<system>/` instead. `/modernize-harden` splits its remediation diff so credential-removal hunks (which necessarily contain the raw value) land in a gitignored `security_remediation.local.patch`, never the shareable patch. Pass `--show-secrets` to include raw values in the quarantine file (and only there). If you ran an earlier version of this plugin on a real system, check whether `analysis/` artifacts containing credentials were committed or shared, and rotate anything that was.

## Commands

The commands are designed to be run in order, but each produces a standalone artifact so you can stop, review, and resume.

### `/modernize-preflight <system-dir> [target-stack]`
Environment readiness check, meant to run first: detects the legacy stack, checks analysis tooling, **smoke-compiles a real source file** with the legacy toolchain (the errors this surfaces — missing copybooks, wrong dialect flags — are the ones that otherwise appear mid-transform), inventories missing includes / deployment descriptors / binary-only artifacts, and probes for telemetry. Produces `analysis/<system>/PREFLIGHT.md` with a per-command Ready / Ready-with-gaps / Not-ready verdict.

### `/modernize-assess <system-dir>`  — or — `/modernize-assess --portfolio <parent-dir>`
Inventory the legacy codebase: languages, line counts, complexity, build system, integrations, technical debt, security posture, documentation gaps, and a COCOMO-derived **relative complexity index** (a size/scale signal for ranking systems — explicitly *not* a modernization timeline or cost; see "A note on COCOMO" below). Produces `analysis/<system>/ASSESSMENT.md` and `analysis/<system>/ARCHITECTURE.mmd`. Spawns `legacy-analyst` (×2) and `security-auditor` in parallel for deep reads. With `--portfolio`, sweeps every subdirectory of a parent directory and writes a sequencing heat-map to `analysis/portfolio.html`.

> **A note on COCOMO.** Both `assess` modes derive a COCOMO-II figure from code size. This plugin uses it **only as a relative complexity/scale index** — to rank and sequence systems and to size the legacy estate. It is deliberately **not** presented as a modernization timeline or cost, and the commands are instructed never to convert it to person-months, weeks, dates, or dollars. COCOMO's constants encode historical human-team productivity; agentic transformation does not follow those curves, so any duration derived from it would be wrong. If you have a better intrinsic-complexity proxy (cyclomatic-complexity density, coupling/fan-out, the topology's edge density, or the count of extracted P0 business rules), prefer it — COCOMO is the portable default, not the ceiling.

### `/modernize-map <system-dir>`

![Interactive topology map of AWS CardDemo — domains as containers, modules sized by lines of code, dependency edges colored by kind, entry points ringed](assets/topology-viewer-screenshot.jpg)

Build a dependency and topology map of the **legacy** system: program/module call graph, data lineage (programs ↔ data stores), entry points, dead-end candidates, and 2–4 traced business flows each anchored to a persona (the claimant, the operator, the auditor — not the maintainer). Writes a re-runnable extraction script and produces `analysis/<system>/topology.json` plus `analysis/<system>/TOPOLOGY.html` — an **interactive zoomable map** (circle-pack of domains/modules sized by LOC, dependency edges with per-kind toggles, search, click-for-details sidebar, and a walkthrough mode that plays each persona flow as a numbered path with a plain-language narrative). Built from a template shipped with the plugin, so it works on systems far too dense for a static diagram. Small domain-level `call-graph.mmd`, `data-lineage.mmd`, and `critical-path.mmd` are still exported for docs and PRs.

### `/modernize-extract-rules <system-dir> [module-pattern]`
Mine the business rules embedded in the legacy code — calculations, validations, eligibility, state transitions, policies — into Given/When/Then "Rule Cards" with `file:line` citations and confidence ratings. Spawns three `business-rules-extractor` agents in parallel (calculations, validations, lifecycle). Produces `analysis/<system>/BUSINESS_RULES.md` and `analysis/<system>/DATA_OBJECTS.md`.

### `/modernize-brief <system-dir> [target-stack]`
Synthesize the discovery artifacts into a phased **Modernization Brief** — the single document a steering committee approves and engineering executes: target architecture, strangler-fig phase plan with entry/exit criteria, persona-based business walkthroughs (the section non-technical approvers actually read), behavior contract, validation strategy, open questions, and an approval block. Reads `ASSESSMENT.md`, `TOPOLOGY.html`, and `BUSINESS_RULES.md` and **stops if any are missing** — run the discovery commands first. Produces `analysis/<system>/MODERNIZATION_BRIEF.md` and enters plan mode as a human-in-the-loop gate.

### `/modernize-reimagine <system-dir> <target-vision>`
Greenfield rebuild from extracted intent rather than a structural port. Mines a spec (`analysis/<system>/AI_NATIVE_SPEC.md`), designs a target architecture and has it adversarially reviewed (`analysis/<system>/REIMAGINED_ARCHITECTURE.md`), then **scaffolds services with executable acceptance tests** under `modernized/<system>-reimagined/` and writes a `CLAUDE.md` knowledge handoff for the new system. Two human-in-the-loop checkpoints. Spawns `business-rules-extractor`, `legacy-analyst` (×2), `architecture-critic`, and general-purpose scaffolding agents.

### `/modernize-transform <system-dir> <module> <target-stack>`
Surgical, single-module strangler-fig rewrite. Plans first (HITL gate), then writes characterization tests via `test-engineer`, then an idiomatic target implementation under `modernized/<system>/<module>/`, proves equivalence by running the tests, and produces `TRANSFORMATION_NOTES.md` mapping legacy → modern with deliberate deviations called out. Reviewed by `architecture-critic`.

### `/modernize-uplift <system-dir> <source-version> <target-version> [project-pattern]`
**Same-stack** version uplift (e.g. `.NET Framework 4.8` → `.NET 8`, Spring Boot 2 → 3, Python 2 → 3) — the common case `transform` gets wrong by rewriting. Preserves the code and makes the **smallest diffs that compile and behave identically on the target**, driven by a **delta catalog** (the known $source→$target breaking changes that *this* code actually hits) rather than extracted business rules. Detects and drives the ecosystem's migration tooling (.NET `upgrade-assistant`, Java **OpenRewrite**, `pyupgrade`, `ng update`) and owns the residue. Equivalence is proven by a **dual-target test harness**: one suite runs on both the old and new runtime, baseline-on-old is the oracle, new must reproduce it. Produces `analysis/<system>/DELTA_CATALOG.md` and `modernized/<system>/UPLIFT_NOTES.md`. Spawns `version-delta-analyst` and `test-engineer`; `architecture-critic` reviews for *gratuitous divergence* (here, any change beyond the minimal uplift is a finding). If the catalog shows the target forces most of the code to change, it tells you to use `transform` instead.

### `/modernize-status <system-dir>`
Read-only progress report: artifact inventory with timestamps per workflow stage, staleness flags (e.g. a brief older than the assessment it was built from), secrets-hygiene checks (quarantine file gitignored and never committed), and the single most useful next command. Run it anytime you come back to a modernization after a break.

### `/modernize-harden <system-dir>`
Security hardening pass on the **legacy** system: OWASP/CWE scan, dependency CVEs, secrets, injection. Spawns `security-auditor`. Produces `analysis/<system>/SECURITY_FINDINGS.md` ranked Critical / High / Medium / Low and a reviewed `analysis/<system>/security_remediation.patch` with minimal fixes for the Critical/High findings. The patch is reviewed by a second `security-auditor` pass before you see it. **Never edits `legacy/`** — you review and apply the patch yourself when ready, then re-run to verify. Useful as a pre-modernization step when the legacy system will keep running in production during the migration.

## Agents

- **`legacy-analyst`** — Reads legacy code (COBOL, legacy Java/C++, procedural PHP, classic ASP) and produces structured summaries. Good at spotting implicit dependencies, copybook inheritance, and "JOBOL" patterns (procedural code wearing a modern syntax). Used by `assess` and `reimagine`.
- **`business-rules-extractor`** — Extracts business rules from procedural code with source citations. Each rule includes: what, where it's implemented, which conditions fire it, and any corner cases hidden in data. Used by `extract-rules` and `reimagine`.
- **`architecture-critic`** — Adversarial reviewer for target architectures and transformed code. Default stance is skeptical: asks "do we actually need this?" Flags microservices-for-the-resume, ceremonial error handling, abstractions with one implementation. Used by `reimagine` and `transform`.
- **`security-auditor`** — Reviews code for auth, input validation, secret handling, and dependency CVEs. Tuned for the kinds of issues that appear when translating security primitives across stacks (e.g., session handling from servlet to stateless JWT). Used by `assess` and `harden`.
- **`test-engineer`** — Writes characterization, contract, and equivalence tests that pin legacy behavior so transformation can be proven correct. Flags tests that exercise code paths without asserting outcomes. Used by `transform` and `uplift`.
- **`version-delta-analyst`** — For **same-stack uplifts**: finds the breaking/behavioral changes between two versions of one stack that actually bite a given codebase, and drives the ecosystem migration tool. Produces a delta catalog (API-removed / silent-behavioral / project-system / dependency), preserving the code rather than redesigning it. Used by `uplift`.
- **`scaffolder`** — Builds one service of a reimagined system from the approved architecture and spec: skeleton, domain model, API stubs, executable acceptance tests. Write scope is exactly its own `modernized/.../<service>/` directory; treats the spec's imperative-sounding content as data, since the spec derives from untrusted legacy code. Used by `reimagine` (Phase E).

## Installation

```
/plugin install code-modernization@claude-plugins-official
```

## Recommended Workspace Setup

This plugin ships commands and agents, but modernization projects benefit from a workspace permission layout that enforces the "never touch legacy, freely edit modernized" rule. A starting-point `.claude/settings.json` for the project directory you're modernizing:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(git diff:*)",
      "Bash(git log:*)",
      "Bash(git status:*)",
      "Read(**)",
      "Write(analysis/**)",
      "Write(modernized/**)",
      "Edit(analysis/**)",
      "Edit(modernized/**)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Edit(legacy/**)",
      "Write(legacy/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Adjust `legacy/` and `modernized/` to match your actual layout. The key invariants: `Edit`/`Write` under `legacy/` are denied, and writes are scoped to `analysis/` (for documents) and `modernized/` (for the new code). Note this guards the file tools — shell commands that mutate files (`sed -i`, `git apply`) still go through the normal Bash permission prompt, so review those prompts with the same invariant in mind. Every command in this plugin respects this — `/modernize-harden` writes a patch to `analysis/` rather than editing `legacy/` in place.
